I’m a Software Engineer who thrives on focus and deep work, specializing in building efficient, scalable, and maintainable backend systems using Java and Spring.

My core strength lies in designing robust architectures that meet both business goals and technical standards. I place strong emphasis on writing clean, well-structured code that follows Clean Code principles and SOLID design practices. I actively leverage modern design patterns to simplify complexity, enhance performance, and make systems easier to maintain.

I’m a strong advocate of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and frequently use JUnit5 and Mockito to write reliable, high-coverage test suites.

I value continuous learning in a fast-evolving tech landscape and enjoy sharing insights and lessons through my technical blog. I'm always eager to explore new tools and methodologies that help me write better software and solve complex engineering challenges.
