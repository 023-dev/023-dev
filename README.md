## About Me

**I’m a highly driven Software Engineer with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable backend systems using modern Java and Spring technologies.**

My core strength lies in designing robust system architectures that align with both business goals and engineering best practices. I place a strong emphasis on clean code, modular design, and thoughtful abstraction — always aiming to create maintainable and extensible systems.

I have hands-on experience with layered architecture, hexagonal architecture, and domain-driven design (DDD). I actively apply proven design patterns such as factory, strategy, and builder to manage complexity and improve code clarity. I also enjoy applying architectural patterns like event-driven architecture and CQRS when solving problems at scale.

With a strong belief in writing testable, reliable code, I advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and frequently use JUnit5 and Mockito to build high-quality test suites.

My key interests include backend architecture, scalable system design, database performance optimization, and building resilient services through clean and consistent architectural principles. I enjoy collaborating with other engineers to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and continuously improve both code and team processes.
