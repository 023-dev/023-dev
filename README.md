## About Me

**I’m a highly driven Software Engineer with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable backend systems using modern Java and Spring technologies.**

My core strength lies in designing robust system architectures that align with both business goals and engineering best practices. I place a strong emphasis on clean code, modular design, and thoughtful abstraction — always aiming to create maintainable and extensible systems.

Recently, I’ve been exploring advanced architectural principles and patterns that support scalable and resilient backend systems. I'm particularly interested in **layered architecture**, **hexagonal architecture**, and **domain-driven design (DDD)**. I also enjoy studying **design patterns** such as factory, strategy, and builder, as well as **architectural styles** like **event-driven architecture** and **CQRS** to improve system flexibility and clarity.

With a strong belief in writing testable, reliable code, I advocate for **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** and frequently use **JUnit5** and **Mockito** to build high-quality test suites.

My key interests include backend architecture, scalable system design, database performance optimization, and building resilient services through clean and consistent architectural principles. I enjoy collaborating with other engineers to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and continuously improve both code and team processes.
