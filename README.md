## About me

**I’m a highly driven Software Engineer with a strong focus on building efficient, scalable backend systems using modern Java and Spring technologies.**

My core strength lies in designing robust system architectures that align with both business goals and engineering best practices. I place a strong emphasis on clean code, modular design, and thoughtful abstraction always aiming to create maintainable and extensible systems.

My key interests include backend architecture, scalable system design, database performance optimization, and building resilient services through clean and consistent architectural principles. I also enjoy collaborating with fellow engineers to exchange ideas, challenge assumptions, and continuously refine both code quality and team workflows.
